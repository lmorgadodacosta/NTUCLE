# NTU Corpus of Learner English (NTUCLE)


The NTU Corpus of Learner English is a hand-annotated Corpus of Learner English developed in collaboration with the [Language and Communication Centre](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/lcc) at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. 


The main goal of this corpus was to develop the LCC-NTU English Writing Support System (capable of providing corrective feedback on students' writing), which is now integrated in the [iTELL](https://github.com/lmorgadodacosta/iTELL) suite of applications.

You can read a full description of the corpus, of the new error tag set and annotation process in this
