# NTU Corpus of Learner English (NTUCLE)


The NTU Corpus of Learner English is a hand-annotated Corpus of Learner English developed in collaboration with the [Language and Communication Centre](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/lcc) at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. 


The main goal of this corpus was to develop the LCC-NTU English Writing Support System (capable of providing corrective feedback on students' writing), which is now integrated in the [iTELL](https://github.com/lmorgadodacosta/iTELL) suite of applications.

The corpus contains 180 documents hand-tagged by professional English lecturers. One third (60) of the documents were tagged by two lecturers. Documents that were annotated by two people had their error tags harmonized/adjudicated. A list of documents and whether they have been double annotated can be found in the file [annot_doc.tsv](annot_doc.tsv).


You can read a full description of the corpus, of the new error tag set and of its annotation process in our 
 [paper](https://aclanthology.org/W17-5901/).

The corpus is provided in a simple XML schema. The corpus is organized in three main layers: documents, sentences and words. Errors are SubElements of sentences but are explicitely linked to any number of words in that sentence. A mapping to the full description of error labels is provided above (and in even greater detail in the reference [paper](https://aclanthology.org/W17-5901/)). Here is a simple example:
